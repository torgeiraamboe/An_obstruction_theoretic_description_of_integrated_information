\textbf{%
We define the integrated cohomology groups of physical systems, and show that integrated information can be detected by the non-vanishing of $H^1$ obstruction classes that measures the failure of the cause-effect properties of the system to decompose into smaller parts. This allows us to further define higher order integration in a very natural way, and gives a completely functorial notion of integrated information, as suggested by Tull--Kleiner.}
